**Deployment is fully automated!** See [VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md](./VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

### Option 2: Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/quibitai/Wednes-Days.git
cd Wednes-Days

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Initial Setup
1. **Launch the application** (deployed or local)
2. **Enter co-parent names** (e.g., "Jane" and "Adam")  
3. **Select start date** and initial person for custody
4. **Review the generated schedule** with default 3-day rotations

### Managing Unavailability
1. **Click calendar dates** to select unavailable periods
2. **Choose the unavailable person** from the form
3. **Review the preview** showing schedule adjustments
4. **Confirm or adjust** based on warnings and impact analysis

### Using AI Features (v2.2.0+)
1. **Natural Language Commands**: Type requests like "I can't have Emma next Friday" 
2. **Smart Rebalancing**: AI automatically creates optimal 3-night custody blocks
3. **Preview Changes**: Review AI proposals with detailed explanations before accepting
4. **Footer Actions**: Use Accept/Discard buttons in the calendar footer
5. **Fallback Protection**: System automatically falls back to algorithmic approach if AI fails

### Understanding Warnings
- **Yellow warnings**: 4-day rule violations that you can override
- **Schedule adjustments**: Automatic reassignments to resolve conflicts
- **Handoff counts**: Number of custody transitions created

### Using AI Features (v2.2.0+)
1. **Natural Language Commands**: Type requests like "I can't have Emma next Friday" 
2. **Smart Rebalancing**: AI automatically creates optimal 3-night custody blocks
3. **Preview Changes**: Review AI proposals with detailed explanations before accepting
4. **Footer Actions**: Use Accept/Discard buttons in the calendar footer
5. **Fallback Protection**: System automatically falls back to algorithmic approach if AI fails

### Best Practices
- **Plan ahead**: Mark unavailability as early as possible
- **Review warnings**: Consider the impact on your co-parent before overriding rules
- **Regular check-ins**: Review the schedule weekly for upcoming conflicts

## üèó Architecture

### Storage Strategy
The application uses a sophisticated multi-backend storage system:

```
Storage Priority:
1. Vercel KV (production-grade, 2s polling)
2. Vercel Blob (alternative cloud storage, 5s polling) 
3. Firebase Firestore (real-time database)
4. localStorage (offline fallback, instant sync)
```

### Scheduling Algorithm
Advanced conflict resolution with four strategies:

1. **Early Handoff**: Hand over custody before the unavailable day
2. **Extension**: Extend the other person's period through the conflict
3. **Period Shift**: Adjust custody period boundaries intelligently
4. **Forced Assignment**: Allow violations with comprehensive warnings

### Real-time Synchronization
- **Cross-tab updates**: Changes sync across browser tabs instantly
- **Multi-device support**: Real-time updates across phones, tablets, and computers
- **Conflict prevention**: Automatic refresh when external changes are detected

## üìä Storage Options & Configuration

### AI Configuration (Required for v2.2.0+)
Enable intelligent schedule rebalancing with OpenAI:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### Vercel Storage (Recommended)
Perfect for production deployments with automatic scaling:

```env
KV_REST_API_URL=your_kv_rest_api_url
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your_kv_rest_api_token
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_blob_read_write_token
```

### Firebase Configuration

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### LocalStorage Fallback
No configuration needed! Works offline with full functionality.
