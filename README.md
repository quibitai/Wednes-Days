## üìñ Usage Guide

### Initial Setup
1. **Launch the application** (deployed or local)
2. **Enter co-parent names** (e.g., "Jane" and "Adam")  
3. **Select start date** and initial person for custody
4. **Review the generated schedule** with default 3-day rotations

### Managing Unavailability
1. **Click calendar dates** to select unavailable periods
2. **Choose the unavailable person** from the form
3. **Review the preview** showing schedule adjustments
4. **Confirm or adjust** based on warnings and impact analysis

### Understanding Warnings
- **Yellow warnings**: 4-day rule violations that you can override
- **Schedule adjustments**: Automatic reassignments to resolve conflicts
- **Handoff counts**: Number of custody transitions created

### Best Practices
- **Plan ahead**: Mark unavailability as early as possible
- **Review warnings**: Consider the impact on your co-parent before overriding rules
- **Regular check-ins**: Review the schedule weekly for upcoming conflicts

## üèó Architecture

### Storage Strategy
The application uses a sophisticated multi-backend storage system:

```
Storage Priority:
1. Vercel KV (production-grade, 2s polling)
2. Vercel Blob (alternative cloud storage, 5s polling) 
3. Firebase Firestore (real-time database)
4. localStorage (offline fallback, instant sync)
```

### Scheduling Algorithm
Advanced conflict resolution with four strategies:

1. **Early Handoff**: Hand over custody before the unavailable day
2. **Extension**: Extend the other person's period through the conflict
3. **Period Shift**: Adjust custody period boundaries intelligently
4. **Forced Assignment**: Allow violations with comprehensive warnings

### Real-time Synchronization
- **Cross-tab updates**: Changes sync across browser tabs instantly
- **Multi-device support**: Real-time updates across phones, tablets, and computers
- **Conflict prevention**: Automatic refresh when external changes are detected

## üìä Storage Options & Configuration
